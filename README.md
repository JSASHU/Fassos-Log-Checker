## Quick Start

  The quickest way to get started with application is just go to the open the terminal with the current working directory of application and then follow the below step.

  1. set NODE_ENV=default && npm start (on windows system) 
  2. NODE_ENV=default npm start (on nix system) 


  Note : Assuming you installed node.js and npm packages also in working condition.

  Once you do the npm start command it'll automatically install the application dependency and start the application on the given port of 3000( default port).
